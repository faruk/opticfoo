This is a program about VJing in 3d inside a game engine.

About
-----

This is the project repository for my bachelor thesis. Its about a 
VJing concept with heavy use of keyboard for performance. You'll also 
need mouse to use the GUI. Basically it is a virtual 3d room where you 
can place visuals and watch them.


Installation
------------

In order to run this code you will need 

    * panda3d (v1.8)
    * several python libs like alsaaudio, audioop, fftw3, numpy

For the models you'll need to setup the model's path in the 'Config.prc' 
file.
